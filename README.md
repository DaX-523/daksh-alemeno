Credit Approval System
The Credit Approval System is designed to manage and process loan statements and payments, providing a clear and user-friendly interface for credit management. This guide will walk you through setting up the system, configuring your database, and testing the API endpoints.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the application:

1. Clone the Repository
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone URL_TO_REPOSITORY
cd into_the_cloned_repo 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required npm packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install 3. Configure the Database
Before running the application, you must create and configure your database:

Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your machine. If not, download it from postgresql.org.
Create a new database named credit_approval_db or a name of your choice.
Configure your database connection settings in a config/database.js file or through environment variables. Here’s a sample configuration:
javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
username: "your_db_username",
password: "your_db_password",
database: "credit_approval_db",
host: "127.0.0.1",
dialect: "postgres"
}; 4. Ingest Data
Before using the API, populate the database by calling the /ingest-data endpoint:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ingest-data
This step is crucial for setting up initial data in your system.

5. Start the Server
   Run the server using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on the default port 9000. This can be changed by setting the PORT environment variable in your terminal or within a .env file.

API Documentation
You can test the API endpoints using Postman, which is a popular tool for testing APIs. Alternatives to Postman include:

Insomnia: Similar to Postman, provides a simple user interface to send requests and view responses.
Swagger UI: If integrated, allows you to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.
Available Endpoints
View Loan Statement
GET /api/v1/loan-statement/:loan_id
Retrieves the statement for a specific loan.
Use these endpoints with the /api/v1 prefix to access the functionalities.

Changing Database Connection Configuration
To adapt the application for different environments, change the database connection details in the config/database.js file or modify the relevant environment variables in your deployment setup.

Conclusion
This README provides all the necessary steps to get your Credit Approval System up and running. Be sure to follow each step carefully and adjust configurations according to your local setup or production needs. Happy coding!
